# SpeedyForward: YouTubeâ„¢ Ad Skipper

This extension is designed to monitor advertisements, automatically seek the ads, and skip them. It's important to note that this doesn't classify as traditional ad blocking, as the ad content is technically "loaded".

Nevertheless, the extension's underlying logic enables it to fast-forward through the ad content to its conclusion. The entire process is optimized to occur within an extremely brief timeframe, typically <=100 milliseconds, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted user experience.

## Features

- Monitors and skips YouTube ads automatically.
- Uses Chrome extension debugger to bypass specific ads.
- Ensures a smooth and uninterrupted viewing experience.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing this extension.

## Usage

Once installed, the extension will automatically start monitoring and skipping ads on YouTube. No further configuration is required.

## Note

If you're still getting YouTube's Adblock warnings or black screens, disable extensions one-by-one until you find the culprit.
